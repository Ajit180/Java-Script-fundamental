Question 4: Use a ternary operator to check that a person is eligible to vote or not by checking his age. If the age of the
person is less than 18 then “You cannot vote” should be logged else “You can vote” should be logged.


Solutions: 
  
     You can use a ternary operator in JavaScript to check if a person is eligible to vote based on their age. If the person's age is less than 18, it should log "You cannot vote"; otherwise, it should log "You can vote".

Here's how you can do it:

javascript
let age = 17; // You can change this value to test with other ages

// Using ternary operator to determine if the person can vote
let eligibility = (age < 18) ? "You cannot vote" : "You can vote";

console.log(eligibility);


### Explanation
- `(age < 18)`: This condition checks if the age is less than 18.
- If the condition is true (the age is less than 18), it returns "You cannot vote".
- If the condition is false (the age is 18 or older), it returns "You can vote".
- The result is stored in the variable `eligibility`.
- The `console.log` statement prints the eligibility message.

### Example Output
- For `age = 17`, the output will be:
  
  You cannot vote
  

- For `age = 18`, the output will be:
  
  You can vote
  

- For `age = 25`, the output will be:
  
  You can vote
  

This way, the ternary operator provides a concise and readable way to handle the voting eligibility check based on the person's age.
