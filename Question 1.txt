Question 1:  Explain the usage of ternary operator with syntax and write a program to check whether the number is even or odd using the ternary operator.

Solution:   



The ternary operator in JavaScript is a compact way to perform conditional operations. It is the only operator in JavaScript that takes three operands. The syntax for the ternary operator is:

javascript
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;


- condition: This is the condition to be evaluated.
- expressionIfTrue: This is the expression to be executed if the condition is true.
- expressionIfFalse: This is the expression to be executed if the condition is false.

Here's a step-by-step example of using the ternary operator to check if a number is even or odd in JavaScript:

1. Define the number you want to check.
2. Use the ternary operator to check the condition (whether the number is even or odd).
3. Print the result.

javascript
let number = 4; // You can change this number to test with other values

// Using the ternary operator to check if the number is even or odd
let result = (number % 2 === 0) ? "even" : "odd";

console.log(`The number ${number} is ${result}.`);


### Explanation:
- `number % 2 === 0`: This condition checks if the remainder of `number` divided by 2 is zero. If it is, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd.
- If the condition is true (`number` is even), `expressionIfTrue` ("even") is returned.
- If the condition is false (`number` is odd), `expressionIfFalse` ("odd") is returned.
- The result is stored in the variable `result`.
- The `console.log` statement prints out whether the number is even or odd.

### Example Output:
For `number = 4`, the output will be:

The number 4 is even.


For `number = 5`, the output will be:

The number 5 is odd.


This way, the ternary operator allows for a concise and readable way to handle simple conditional checks and assignments in a single line of code.
